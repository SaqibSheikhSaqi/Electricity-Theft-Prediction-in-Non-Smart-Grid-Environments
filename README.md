By employing careful direct and indirect feature engineering techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), and resampling methods such as Random-Under-Sampler (RUS), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and Random-Over-Sampler (ROS), an effective solution is proposed. Previous studies indicate that models achieve high precision, recall, and F1 score for the non-theft (0) class, but perform poorly, even achieving 0%, for theft (1) class. Through parameter tuning and employing Random-Over-Sampler (ROS), significant improvements in accuracy, precision (89%), recall (94%), and F1 score (91%) for the theft (1) class are achieved.
The dataset is obtained from the "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshatrailaddha/electricity-theft-detection-dataset", it has consumption records of 42373 customers. For every client, there has been electricity use of 1,034 days from year 2014 to 2016.
